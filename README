# Calculator

This embedded system project combines software and hardware design to calculate simple arithmetic operations.

## Hardware Components
- Atmega32
- LCD
- Keypad

## Challenges

- Calculate more than a single arithmetic operation according to the precedence of each operation.
- Handle floating digits because Atmega32 doesn't FPU.
- Can support numbers bigger than one digit.
- Detect invalid operations.
- Handle negative numbers.
